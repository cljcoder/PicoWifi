* Simple WiFi connections with a Pi Pico

A modification of an exmaple program connecting a Pico W to wifi and
using a small webserver to control the LED.

For this example we create a timer that shows the status of the WiFi
every 10 seconds.


To use this code, copy the given secrets_example.py to secrets.py and
modify to suit the settings for your WiFi network.  Then upload all of
the non-hidden files in the directory to your Pi (with Thonny or your
choice of editor/IDE), and give main.py a test run.
